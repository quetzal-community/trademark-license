        that Platform.

    (c) "Larger Works", which means any larger work where the work's Source 
        is kept external and separate from the This Project's Source and where

        meaningfully separated from the Larger Work and This Project can continue 
        to function and remain useful for its intended purpose without any

    may be preceded by zero or more comma-separated trademarks. Each trademark is 
    associated with the copyright holder that added the copyright notice (it is 
    one of theirs), and each trademark added this way is considered to be a 
    "Community Trademark" when:

    (a) it is the appropriate legal representation of a trademark, or is a 
        term or phrase followed by, the unicode trademark symbol, '(TM)' 
        or '(R)', and

    (b) it is unique and "Distinguishable" which means, a reasonable 
        person will not confuse the trademark with a previously recorded
        Community Trademark.

        the copyright holder is permitted to use by law.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THIS PROJECT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE

QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THIS PROJECT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THIS PROJECT PROVE 
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR USES THIS PROJECT 
AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
